# Assassins Essentials

**Some features include:**

* Jumping on hay with no fall damage

* Assassinating other people with a "knife" (arrow) from a high place without taking fall damage. (If you miss it is a big laugh emoji. This is especially true when the attacker dies from the fall.)

* Explosive eggs

* Random spawn locations

* Secure players (they have to type in an extra password)

Note: _I believe there may be a bug involving hitting another player with a "knife" and not taking fall damage. I may or may not investigate this sometime in the future._
