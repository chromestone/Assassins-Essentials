Assassins Essentials

Some features include:

Jumping on hay with no fall damage

Assassinating other people with a "knife" (arrow) from a high place without taking fall damage

Explosive eggs

Random spawn locations

secure players (they have to type in an extra password)

Note: I beleive there is a bug involving hitting another player with a "knife" and not taking fall damage. I may or may not investigate this sometime in the future.
